# Instructions to contribute
1. Fork the project.
2. Clone your fork with the Git command `git clone <url>`
3. Create development branches (as many as you need) with the commands:  

    ```  
    git branch  
    git checkout -b <name_of_new_branch>  
    git checkout <name_of_new_branch>  
    ```

4. Edit files in desired branch and check with `git status`
5. Add the edited files to the staging area with the command `git add .`
6. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Description of the changes"
7. Push to GitHub: `Git Push`
8. When you think the feature is ready to be included in the main project, initiate a pull request.

Please write your code and comments in English.

## Tip
Create branches for all your development. Do not commit to the master branch even in your fork. By doing this, you will avoid
merge conflicts when updating your fork.
